				<p>Any multiplayer game worth it's salt provides some kind of matchmaking. Which is great, especially if you enjoy your sexual orientation being called into question by a 10 year old. Or maybe you'd rather they go on and on about their exploits with the matriarch of your family. GamePop to the rescue!</p>
				<p>You probably have friends, we hope.  Chances are you are also part of at least one social network, Twitter, Facebook, etc, etc. Let your friends and communities know you are up for throwing one down with GamePop.</p>
